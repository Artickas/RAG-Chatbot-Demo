# RAG Customer Support Chatbot Demo
This repository contains a simplified demonstration of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system applied to a customer support chatbot. The goal is to show how an LLM can provide accurate and context-specific answers by referencing an external knowledge base, rather than relying solely on its pre-trained data.
The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and execution, simulating interaction with multiple text files as a product documentation knowledge base.

## Project Structure
* `RAG_Customer_Support_Chatbot.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and explanations for the RAG system.
* `product_docs/`: A directory that will be created by the notebook, containing simulated text files that act as our product documentation knowledge base (e.g., `product_manual_xyz.txt`, `faq_warranty.txt`, `troubleshooting_guide.txt`).

## What Does This Demo Illustrate?
This demo illustrates the core components and flow of a RAG system:
1. **Knowledge Base Ingestion**: How external documents (product manuals, FAQs) are processed, chunked into smaller pieces, and converted into numerical "embeddings." These embeddings are then stored in a simulated "vector database."
2. **Query Processing**: How a user's question is also converted into an embedding.
3. **Information Retrieval**: How the system efficiently finds the most relevant document chunks from the knowledge base based on the similarity between the query's embedding and the document chunks' embeddings (using conceptual cosine similarity).
4. **Prompt Augmentation**: How the retrieved, relevant information is combined with the original user query to create a rich, context-aware prompt for a Language Model.
5. **Grounded Generation**: How a (simulated) Language Model uses this augmented prompt to generate an accurate and relevant response, "grounded" in the provided external context.
This approach helps mitigate common LLM issues like "hallucinations" and provides up-to-date information without requiring constant retraining of the base LLM.

## How to Run the Demo
To run this Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
  * Python 3.x installed.
  * pip (Python package installer).
  * Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) is installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install notebook
    # or for JupyterLab
    # pip install jupyterlab
    ```
  * NumPy installed:
    ```
    pip install numpy
    ```
2. **Clone the Repository (or Download the Notebook):**
  * If you've cloned this repository from GitHub:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub details.)

  * If you've just downloaded the `.ipynb` file, navigate to the directory where you saved it.

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  This command will open a browser window showing the Jupyter dashboard.

4. **Open the Notebook:**
  * In the Jupyter dashboard, navigate to and click on RAG_Customer_Support_Chatbot.ipynb (or whatever you named your notebook file).

5. **Execute Cells:**
  * Go through the notebook cell by cell, executing each one sequentially (`Shift + Enter`).
  * The first code cell will create the `product_docs` directory and the dummy text files.
  * Subsequent cells will define the RAG components, ingest the documents, and allow you to test the chatbot.
  * The final cell is for optional cleanup, removing the created `product_docs` directory.

## Further Exploration (Next Steps)
* **Real Embeddings**: Replace the `EmbeddingModel` with a real one (e.g., from the `sentence-transformers` library) for actual semantic similarity.
* **Real LLM**: Integrate with a real LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) instead of the `simulated_llm function`.
* **Persistent Vector Database**: Explore using actual vector databases like `ChromaDB`, `FAISS`, `Pinecone`, or `Weaviate` to handle larger datasets and persistent storage.
* **Advanced Chunking**: Implement more sophisticated document chunking strategies using libraries like `LangChain`.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Think about how you would evaluate the performance and accuracy of such a RAG system.
