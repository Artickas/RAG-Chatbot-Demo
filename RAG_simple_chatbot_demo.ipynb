Instead of relying on a pre-trained LLM's static knowledge, our chatbot will \"augment\" its responses by retrieving relevant information from a small, simulated knowledge base of product documents.\n",

    "   Welcome to your new XYZ Wireless Earbuds! These earbuds offer high-quality audio and a comfortable fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Charging:\n",
    "   To charge your earbuds, place them in the charging case. The LED indicator on the case will show battery status. A full charge takes approximately 1.5 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pairing:\n",
    "   Open the charging case. The earbuds will automatically enter pairing mode. On your device (phone/laptop), go to Bluetooth settings and select \"XYZ Earbuds\". The earbuds will emit a sound upon successful connection.\n",

    "   - If audio is distorted, check your device's volume and ensure no interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Resetting the Earbuds:\n",
    "   To reset your XYZ Wireless Earbuds to factory settings, place both earbuds in the charging case. Press and hold the button on the charging case for 15 seconds until the LED light blinks red three times. Then, close the case and reopen it.\n",

    "Q: What is the warranty period for the XYZ Earbuds?\n",
    "A: The XYZ Wireless Earbuds come with a 1-year limited warranty from the date of purchase. Please retain your proof of purchase for warranty claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do I claim warranty?\n",
    "A: To claim warranty, please visit our support page at [www.xyztech.com/support](https://www.xyztech.com/support) and fill out the warranty claim form, attaching your receipt. Our team will contact you within 2-3 business days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Are the XYZ Earbuds waterproof?\n",
    "A: The XYZ Earbuds are splash-resistant (IPX4 rating), meaning they can withstand light rain and sweat. They are NOT designed for submersion in water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What devices are compatible?\n",
    "A: The earbuds are compatible with any Bluetooth-enabled device, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\n",

    "\n",
    "Issue: One earbud not working.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "1. Ensure both earbuds are charged.\n",
    "2. Try resetting the earbuds (refer to the product manual for instructions).\n",
    "3. Re-pair the earbuds with your device.\n",
    "4. If the issue persists, it might be a hardware problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Low volume or distorted sound.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "1. Check the volume level on your connected device.\n",
    "2. Ensure there's no obstruction in the earbud's speaker grill.\n",
    "3. Try playing audio from a different source to rule out the media file.\n",
